# Music Genre Classification

This project implements a deep learning model to classify music genres using a substantial 45 GB dataset. Leveraging Apache Spark for efficient data processing and scalability, the project demonstrates advanced skills in handling, analyzing, and extracting meaningful insights from large-scale audio data.

## Overview

The Music Genre Classification project involves:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling and preparing a massive dataset of 45 GB of audio data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from the audio data to use as input for the deep learning model.
- **Model Training**: Training a neural network to accurately categorize music into various genres.
- **Integration with Big Data Technologies**: Utilizing Apache Spark to manage and process large datasets efficiently.

The combination of deep learning with big data technologies showcases the ability to build a robust automatic music genre classification solution.

## Features
